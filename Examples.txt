Example 1
On Thursday, a Wisconsin judge agreed that one of two teenagers convicted in the "Slender Man Stabbing" could be released from a psychiatric hospital. Anissa Weier, who is now 19, has been at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute since 2017, after she was found guilty for attempting to kill her friend, Payton Leutner, in order to appease a Slender Man and keep him from harming her family. At the time, Weier was just 12 years old.
Weir was originally sentenced to 25 years in a psychiatric facility, but was released after less than four years on the grounds that "she had made great progress with her treatment and was ready to re-enter society," PEOPLE reported. In a letter obtained by WDJT-TV, Weier wrote that she was not done with her treatment, but that she had "exhausted all the resources available to me at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute. If I am to become a productive member of society, I need to be a part of society."
